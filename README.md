# [Burger Builder Application](https://burger-app-9e90a.firebaseapp.com/)

## Description
This app is part of the final project of 'React 16: the complete guide' on Udemy. It allows you to build a burger with a set of ingredients, make a customizable order, authenticate to see previous orders. It is fully responsive and it looks good on all different screen sizes. The authentication part and the get/post requests are handled through firebase.

React-router is in charge to handle the different routes, rendering different parts of the app. The global state is handled by redux since different parts of the app need to share the same state.
